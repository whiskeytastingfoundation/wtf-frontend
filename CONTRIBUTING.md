## Pull Request Process

1. **Create an issue first** - For significant changes, please open an issue to
   discuss your proposed changes before starting work.

2. **Keep PRs focused** - Each pull request should address a single concern.
   If you have multiple unrelated changes, submit them as separate PRs.

3. **Write good commit messages** - Use clear, descriptive commit messages.
   Reference relevant issues using `#issue-number`.

4. **Add tests** - If you're adding new functionality, please include tests.
   If you're fixing a bug, add a test that would have caught the bug.

5. **Update documentation** - Update the README.md or other documentation if
   your changes affect how users interact with the project.

6. **Wait for review** - A maintainer will review your PR. Please be patient
   and responsive to feedback.

### Sign Your Commits

Licensing is important to open source projects. It provides some assurances that
the software will continue to be available based under the terms that the
author(s) desired. We require that contributors sign off on commits submitted to
our project's repositories. The [Developer Certificate of Origin
(DCO)](https://probot.github.io/apps/dco/) is a way to certify that you wrote and
have the right to contribute the code you are submitting to the project.

You sign-off by adding the following to your commit messages. Your sign-off must
match the git user and email associated with the commit.

```
This is my commit message

Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.name@example.com>
```

Git has a `-s` command line option to do this automatically:

```bash
git commit -s -m 'This is my commit message'
```

If you forgot to do this and have not yet pushed your changes to the remote
repository, you can amend your commit with the sign-off by running:

```bash
git commit --amend -s
```
